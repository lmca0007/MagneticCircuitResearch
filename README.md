This repository provides tools for solving the magnetostatic vector potential formulation of a permanent magnet inside an airbox using FEniCSx / DOLFINx with PETSc backends.


Solves the finite element system for the magnetic vector potential A, and computes the derived magnetic flux density B, exporting results in ParaView-friendly formats.

## Future Plans
Implement geometry solver for target values using gradient descent method.
